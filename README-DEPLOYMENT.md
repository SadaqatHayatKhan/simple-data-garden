# Deployment Guide for AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This guide will help you deploy the application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## Prerequisites
- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- EB CLI installed
- Git

## Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### 1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 2. Initialize Elastic Beanstalk Application
```bash
eb init
```
During initialization:
- Select your region
- Create a new application or select existing one
- Select "Docker" as the platform
- Choose if you want to use CodeCommit (optional)
- Set up SSH for instance access (optional)

### 3. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment
```bash
eb create my-app-environment
```
Replace "my-app-environment" with your desired environment name.

### 4. Deploy the Application
Once your environment is ready, deploy with:
```bash
eb deploy
```

### 5. Open the Application
To view your deployed application:
```bash
eb open
```

### 6. Monitor Your Application
Monitor logs and status:
```bash
eb logs
eb status
```

### 7. For Future Updates
After making changes to your code:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update description"
eb deploy
```

## Important Notes
- Environment variables can be configured through the Elastic Beanstalk console or using the `.ebextensions` configuration files.
- To store your application code in S3, Elastic Beanstalk does this automatically during deployment.
- Make sure your IAM user has the necessary permissions for Elastic Beanstalk and S3.
- For production deployments, consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline.
